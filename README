Emebedded Systems Case Study

For a final year CT3041N module at LMU

A generic project for 8051 microcontroller.
Designed using \emph{MCU 8051 IDE (v1.3.11)}
\cite{sw:mcu8051ide} by \emph{Martin OÅ¡mera}
and \emph{Kara Blackowiak}.

{Foreword Notes}

It had been rather difficult to find
an appropriate partner for group work,
therefore all work was done by one
student.

In order to accomplish the log book
component of this assessment unit,
revision control software has been
utilised. It provides a very appropriate
facility for logging the programming
activities and keeps track of code
modifications. The repository can be
also stored on the Internet \cite{sw:github}.

The best attempt was made at documenting
the code, however details were omitted
for explaining the operation of this very
commonly used type of circuit.

As mentioned above \emph{MCU 8051 IDE} open-source
package had been used. \emph{Small Device C Compiler
(SDCC)} \cite{sw:sdcc} was used to compile the program.
Git \cite{sw:git} revision control and Doxygen \cite{sw:doxygen}
documentation generator were of great help for the project.
