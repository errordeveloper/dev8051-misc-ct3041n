For a final year CT3041N module at LMU -\/ a generic project for {\itshape Intel\/} {\ttfamily 8051} microcontroller.

Designed using {\itshape MCU 8051 IDE (v1.3.11)\/} by {\itshape Martin OÅ¡mera\/} and {\itshape Kara Blackowiak\/}. {\itshape

{\bfseries Foreword Notes}

It had been rather difficult to find an appropriate partner for group work, therefore all work was done by one student, Ilya Dmitrichenko.

In order to accomplish the log book component of this assessment unit, revision control software has been utilised. It provides a very appropriate facility for logging the programming activities and keeps track of code modifications. The repository had been also stored on the Internet {\itshape GitHub\/} portal ({\tt http://github.com/errordeveloper/}).

\end{DoxyItemize}The best attempt was made at documenting the code, however details were omitted for explaining the operation of this very commonly microcontroller used type of circuit.

As mentioned above {\itshape MCU 8051 IDE\/} open-\/source package had been used to test the code in the simulator. {\itshape SDCC\/} was used to compile the program. Git revision control and Doxygen documentation generator were of great help for the project. {\itshape Doxygen\/} extracts tagged comments from the code. {\itshape

{\bfseries Introduction Notes}

This report document details the implementation by describing each of source code files. The description is fallowed by listing of the source code itself. Please note that tagged comments used for description were stripped from the listings. The code under pre-\/processor condition statements relying on definition of 'DOXYGEN' symbol is not to be used by the compiler.

{\itshape Please also note that the code assumes C89 or C99 ISO standard compiler.\/}
